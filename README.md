<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Do you ever feel nervous or anxious about public speaking? If so, you're certainly not alone. Many people struggle with social anxiety, which can make speaking in front of others a daunting task. But the good news is that with practice, anyone can improve their speaking skills and overcome their fears.

That's where Speech Analyzer comes in. This powerful AI-supported app can analyze your video speeches and provide detailed feedback on various parameters like eye contact, facial expression, emotional tone, and sentiment analysis. By using this app, you can identify areas for improvement and practice delivering more effective and engaging speeches over time. With the help of cutting-edge AI technology, you can take your public speaking skills to the next level and achieve greater success and confidence in all areas of your life.

You can analyze your speech with different parameters.
It'll say 
1. How much you made eye contact with the camera.
2. What your face expression was
3. What emotions your words contained
4. Sentiment of your speech between positive and negative.

This is useful to practice public speaking and you can judge how your performance is with an AI.

### Built With
Flask for front end <br>
Gradio for deploying model API in huggingface <br>
huggingface and FAST AI for training and importing model <br>
opencv for isolating the face <br>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Firstly get a video you want to analyze and make sure it's in mp4 format. If it's not in mp4 format you can convert it [Here](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter). Make sure the video has proper lighting and visiblility without any distractions and noise so that it can be analyzed more accurately.

### Prerequisites



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Go to the [Live Demo](https://speech-analyzer.onrender.com/) and upload a video. Wait a few minutes and you'll get the result like below

## Building the project
The codes used for this are given in the notebook folder along with the comments for their use cases.
Data prep was used to collect data and prepare them for model training.
Training was used to train the model. We used resnet 18 because it's small in size and fast. Since we had small dataset our model was performing good.
More complex model needs more datasets else they'd overfit. The model was fine-tuned with 70+ images with 64% accuracy in 5 epochs



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Future work and limitations

1. The eye contact model is not accurate enough as the dataset is not much abundant.
2. The rest of the analysis parameters were used with pretrained models because the dataset and computational power to make those models is not available.
3. Grammer analysis can be a good addition.
4. Since it's hosted on a free platform the output is slow and the video takes frames every few second for eye contact detection to make it faster. This might affect eye contact accuracy.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/AbrarAdnan/speech-analyzer/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
